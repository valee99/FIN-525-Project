## [Project Setup](#setup)
Install required packages with :
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Set up a data folder as following : 
- `mkdir -p data`
Subsequently, download datafrom the [drive](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/0X3Je6DauQRzD2r) provided by the Professor. The data used is called `sp100_2004-8`, which contains data from 2004 to 2008. After downloading the data, store the folder `sp100_2004-8` inside data` as can be observed above in [Project Setup](#setup).
